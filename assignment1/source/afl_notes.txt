Hmm, your system is configured to send core dump notifications to an
    external utility. This will cause issues: there will be an extended delay
    between stumbling upon a crash and having this information relayed to the
    fuzzer via the standard waitpid() API.

    To avoid having crashes misinterpreted as timeouts, please log in as root
    and temporarily modify /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, like so:

    echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern


Whoops, your system uses on-demand CPU frequency scaling, adjusted
    between 781 and 3320 MHz. Unfortunately, the scaling algorithm in the
    kernel is imperfect and can miss the short-lived processes spawned by
    afl-fuzz. To keep things moving, run these commands as root:

    cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
    echo performance | tee cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

    You can later go back to the original state by replacing 'performance' with
    'ondemand'. If you don't want to change the settings, set AFL_SKIP_CPUFREQ
    to make afl-fuzz skip this check - but expect some performance drop.
