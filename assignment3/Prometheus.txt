Part 1 - Removing Unwanted Monitoring

Only unwanted monitoring I found was the password counting. I commented that portion out.

        # KG: Uh... I'm not sure this makes sense.
        # Collect data to ensure good password use.
        #if pword not in graphs.keys():
        #    graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
        #      + f'times {pword} was used')
        #graphs[pword].inc()

Part 2 - Expand reasonable monitoring

Defined counter 

  graphs['404_counter'] = Counter('database_error_return_404', 'The total number'\
  + ' of 404 responses.')

Added increments each time 404 error was returned

  graphs['404_counter'].inc()


Part 3 - Implementing Prometheus

Installing Helm

  https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

    curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
    echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install helm
 
Adding Prometheus repo

    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

Run Prometheus

    helm install prometheus-community/prometheus --generate-name

View config maps 

    kubectl get configmap prometheus-1606493721-server -o yaml > server_configmap.yaml

    kubectl get configmap prometheus-1606493721-alertmanager -o yaml > alertmanager_configmap.yaml

Edit ConfigMap - Only added 4 lines in the scrape_configs section

    kubectl edit configmap prometheus-1606493721-server

        scrape_configs:
        - job_name: prometheus
          static_configs:
          - targets:
            - localhost:9090
        - job_name: giftcardsite
          static_configs:
          - targets:
            - proxy-service:8080

Save current config

    kubectl get configmap prometheus-1606493721-server -o yaml > server_configmap_with_giftcardsite.yaml

Accessing Prometheus

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090

Typed 404 in search bar and suggestions came up, clicked database_error_return_404_total and saw statistics. Provided screenshot in prometheus folder.


I did not provide all yaml files to run prometheus because I used helm and the files and in the repo. To view the files that make up the repo, "helm fetch prometheus-community/prometheus --untar" can be used. The only steps I took and edits I made to the configuration were documented above.
