Part 1 - Removing Unwanted Monitoring

Only unwanted monitoring I found was the password counting. I commented that portion out.

        # KG: Uh... I'm not sure this makes sense.
        # Collect data to ensure good password use.
        #if pword not in graphs.keys():
        #    graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
        #      + f'times {pword} was used')
        #graphs[pword].inc()

Part 2 - Expand reasonable monitoring

Defined counter 

  graphs['404_counter'] = Counter('database_error_return_404', 'The total number'\
  + ' of 404 responses.')

Added increments each time 404 error was returned

  graphs['404_counter'].inc()
